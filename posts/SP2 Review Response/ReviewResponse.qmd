| 1         | It appears to be that those with higher core-number are mostly close friends. Then one could say that the story is actually much simpler: merely engaging with close friends is what matters. Can you argue for using network features, like core-number, against more intuitive metrics such as contact closeness in this context?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Thank you for your constructive comments.

| 2         | A fundamental assumption is that social interactions mainly occur through calls and messages. Although the author has presented data showing a link between self-reported interaction levels and observed call/message frequencies, this doesn't establish that calls/messages are the primary channels of interaction. People could have spent more time on other social platforms and offline activities (with the time spent also aligning with the self-reported interaction levels). How do you plan to address these potential unobserved interactions? Or can you justify they don't affect your results? | This is an important issue that we need to address. Thanks for pointing this out. Indeed, there could be social engagements that are not based on phone call and message: 1) social interactions on other mobile applications; 2) physical interactions that are not based on phone call or messages.                                                                                                   |

| 3         | The implications from your findings are also not clear. The current results show reduced smartphone use when engaging high "core-number" contacts. Does this suggest that one should have more interactions with such contacts to minimize their screen time? But the effect seems to be muted for the heaviest smartphone users, meaning this strategy wouldn't be effective for those who might be really addicted.                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
